# Plug and play phrase-tagger


## About
This is an improvement of the [CRF Ingredient Phrase Tagger](https://github.com/mtlynch/ingredient-phrase-tagger) by [Michael Lynch](https://github.com/mtlynch)

While Michael made several improvements over the original [NY Times ingredient-phrase-tagger](https://github.com/NYTimes/ingredient-phrase-tagger)
it was still far from plug and play.

## Improvements
* Comes with a model pre-trained and included.
* Can read from files which is much more useful than piping input through bash.



The app reads and converts every file in the input folder and places the parsed copy in the output folder.
All the included presents (see below) will use `input` and `ouput` folders in the current directory unless other arguments are passed. The image will create thes folders if they do not exist.


## Running the image
The image is avilable at `pull shivan2418/cdownloader:tagname`

You can run the image in 3 ways:

##### Docker-compose
If you just want to parse some files you can run

* ```docker-compose run --rm parser```

This pulls the image from my docker repo, run with default settings: directories named `input` and `output` in the same directory.

##### Docker-run
Run the image directly from docker hub, you do not even need to download this github repo for this work. 
The below command will again use `input` and `output` folder in the current directory. Change the paths to adjust the input and output folderss.
* `docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)"/output:/app/output -v "$(pwd)"/input:/app/input shivan2418/main_repo:iparser`

##### Build locally and run
If you want maximum control you can build the image locally and then run it.  
* ```docker build -t iparser .```

* ```docker run --rm -v "$(pwd)"/output:/app/output -v "$(pwd)"/input:/app/input iparser```


#### Known issues
On Linux, all the files that you create will be owned by the root. You should run `sudo chown -R -c youruser:youruser output` after running the image to get ownership of the files. 
 
#### Ingredient format
Each input must be a json file in the form of a list of strings as if you `json.dump` as list of strings in python.
